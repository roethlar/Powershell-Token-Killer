# Agent State

This file is the first place future agents should read for current repo state. Keep it
short and update it when important repo facts change.

## Now

- **Implementation started on the owner’s explicit 2026-07-11 go; slice 0 is
  complete with no product-code changes.**
  `.agents/plans/audited-harness-sessions.md` combines
  mandatory PTK-owned/SIEM-exportable audit, private harness-scoped
  process-per-session workers, internal PTK→RTK routing, same-invocation
  output recovery, and no-retry mixed-domain handling. Its frozen slice-0
  results record the absent RTK capture seam, local-only/anchored OTLP
  contracts, exact profile/protocol bounds, carried routing guards, and live
  passing Windows/Unix parent-death probes. Both plan reviewers accepted the
  same approved pre-implementation content. Canonical pre-implementation
  review evidence and fixed-head guards live in `.agents/review/index.md`.
- **Prior security/routing shapes remain evidence, not implementation
  authority.** The declarative policy gate and secret redaction are rejected;
  `.agents/plans/security-layer.md` is prior-art context. The closed review
  findings in `.agents/plans/rtk-rewrite-routing.md` remain regression
  evidence, while its broad rewrite implementation is not approved.
- **`.agents/decisions.md` is UNDER HOLD** (owner, 2026-07-10: do not
  update it until the discussion is complete). The security reframe and RTK
  routing direction still need durable entries after the owner releases the
  hold.
- **Release distribution remains approved work.** Slices 0-2 are landed;
  slice 3 is queued and `.github/workflows/release.yml` is still absent.
  The deliberately open hook-default choice blocks slice 4 only.
- **Standing GitHub authority:** the owner granted persistent permission on
  2026-07-10 to comment, close, and triage issues in this repository as
  appropriate without per-action asks. Pushes remain ask-first.

## Next

1. Await explicit owner go to merge the accepted
   `fix/ahs-37-record-slice0-review` branch. After it lands, implement only
   audited-harness slice 1: mandatory current-server audit foundation,
   exact-script evidence, capacity reservation, and fail-closed pre-effect
   guards.
2. Do not infer approval as a push go; push remains separately ask-first.
3. Execute release-distribution slice 3 under its approved plan. Re-present
   the hook-default choice before slice 4.
4. When the owner releases the decisions hold, reconcile the rejected
   security mechanism, retired durable/shared staging, and PTK→RTK routing
   direction in `.agents/decisions.md`.
5. Push remains ask-first; no push is authorized by plan/review completion.

## Open / Parked

- Warm-backend slice 7 is unblocked open work, currently unscheduled, and
  remains owner-run Windows validation: AD native import/warm reuse; Exchange
  implicit remoting with first-vs-repeated `Get-Queue` latency; EXO/Graph
  unattended certificate auth. Its plan status still needs correction; see
  `## Blockers`.
- Durable checkout and shared runspaces are removed from the candidate build
  scope by the owner's 2026-07-11 direction. Their older open-decision entry
  remains stale while `.agents/decisions.md` is under hold; the idea plan is
  retained as history/evidence, not current implementation direction.
- GitHub issue #3 remains open (verified 2026-07-11): item 1 landed; items
  2-4 are an unplanned follow-up candidate, while its permission-bypass
  concern belongs to the open security track.

## Blockers

- **Decision-log conflict, correction blocked by the owner hold:**
  `.agents/decisions.md` still describes the policy-file gate as the open
  response after its criterion fires, while the later explicit owner call in
  `.agents/plans/security-layer.md` rejects that response. Its shared-host
  entry stages durable GUID sessions followed by sharing, while the owner's
  later direction removes both from the candidate build. Do not implement
  either stale direction; preserve the decision-log conflict until the hold
  is released.
- **Plan-record drift, reported but not edited in this narrow state pass:**
  the warm-runspace plan still says slice 7 is paused behind the already
  decided GO; the release plan retains stale CI/push/policy references; and
  the shared-runspace idea still assumes the rejected policy gate. Explicit
  owner calls, uncontested decisions, and live repo evidence named above
  control.

## Verification

- Automated verification entry point: `.agents/repo-guidance.md`
  (Verification). Review-loop evidence lives in `.agents/review/index.md`;
  do not duplicate volatile counts here.
- Audited-session slice 0 is docs/contracts only. `git diff --check` passed;
  product tests were not run because no runtime/setup/generated behavior
  changed. Machine-specific probe evidence lives in `.agents/machines.md`.
