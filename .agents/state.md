# Agent State

This file is the first place future agents should read for current repo state. Keep it
short and update it when important repo facts change.

## Now

- Module is in a clean, reviewed state. HEAD is 9ae82a3 and `origin/master` matches it
  — nothing is committed-but-unpushed. 31/31 Pester tests passing (last run 2026-07-02).
- A 2026-06-27 design session explored a "universal PowerShell wrapper" rearchitecture
  (triggered by `ptk Get-ChildItem` printing help instead of running). No product code
  was written; the owner deferred the build decision. Recorded as an Open decision
  (b1e0550, docs-only). See `.agents/decisions.md`.
- A follow-on 2026-06-27 exploration looked at giving ptk a session-persistent
  warm-runspace backend (a stdio MCP server owning a `Runspace` that loads heavy
  modules / authenticated connections once). Recorded as a second Open decision in
  `.agents/decisions.md`. The core requirement is warm module load with no reload
  tax; unattended (cert-based) auth is the pattern for connection-bearing modules
  like EXO, not itself the requirement (owner correction 2026-07-02).
- 2026-07-02: owner selected the warm-runspace MCP server as the active work item and
  approved `.agents/plans/warm-runspace-mcp-server.md`. Slices 1-6 are built and
  verified: `server/` holds a net10.0 stdio MCP server (ModelContextProtocol 1.4.0 +
  Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK 7.6.3) with ptk_ping / ptk_invoke / ptk_modules /
  ptk_reset over a single warm runspace (serialized calls, timeout recycle, idle
  self-exit), registered in `.mcp.json` as `dotnet run -v q --project
  server/PtkMcpServer` (verified byte-clean stdout on cold build).
- Measured reload tax on this machine (Pester as the heavy module): cold per-call
  pwsh ≈ 460-500 ms every call; warm server pays 402 ms once, then re-import and
  module use round-trip at ~3 ms per tool call.
- Owner intent that frames future work: ptk is a personal/team tool complementing the
  owner's `headroom` PoC on Windows/PowerShell work, not an org-wide tool. The build
  trigger is measured benefit on real daily Windows usage, not faith. See
  `.agents/repo-guidance.md` for the generalized framing.
- 2026-07-02: governance refreshed from the AgentGovernanceBootstrap toolkit
  (`AGENTS.md` reconciled to the current template; repo-specific content carved into
  the new `.agents/repo-guidance.md` and `.agents/push-policy.md`).

## Next

- Live-session check: the `.mcp.json` `ptk` server is picked up at the NEXT Claude
  Code session start (project MCP servers need one-time approval). Confirm the four
  tools appear and ptk_invoke shares state across calls.
- Slice 7 (owner-run, on the real Windows box): AD/EMS/EXO module load-once behavior
  and the unattended-auth pattern; findings feed Phase 2 scope.
- Phase 2 (separate go): route ptk_invoke output through Compress-PtcObject.
- The "universal PowerShell wrapper" decision (the surface) stays open/deferred; its
  run-anything surface largely falls out of the server's `ptk_invoke` tool anyway.

## Blockers

- None.

## Verification
