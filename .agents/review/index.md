# Review status

Workflow: see `.agents/playbooks/reviewloop.md`.
Per-finding detail: see `.agents/review/findings/<id>.md`.

Loop run 2026-07-04 — reviewer: codex (codex-cli 0.142.5), scope: the
release-distribution plan commits `a43897a..e622cba` (docs/governance only).
Process note: fixes are committed directly to `master`, one finding per
commit, per this repo's recorded codex-loop precedent (`.agents/state.md`,
2026-07-04 routing entry) rather than the playbook's per-finding branches —
the scope is prose in governance files, and the owner-gated push boundary
still applies to the whole batch.

## Legend
- `[ ]` Admitted, open (passed intake triage; not yet started)
- `[~]` In progress / pending review
- `[x]` Verified (awaiting owner-gated merge/push)
- `[!]` Contested — declined, disputed, or ruled invalid; awaiting owner adjudication
- `[-]` Declined at intake (kept for the record; no work)

## Findings

| ID        | Severity | Impact (one line)                                                      | Status | Branch |
|-----------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|
| gov-doc-1 | LOW      | Slice 5 (.NET tool) textually violates the one-`~/.ptk`-home commitment | `[x]`  | master (direct, fd52e1e) |
| gov-doc-2 | LOW      | Plan contradicts itself on PTK_MODULE_PATH in the registration          | `[x]`  | master (direct, 2704cb7) |
| gov-doc-3 | LOW      | state.md still says "four open questions" after owner resolved three    | `[x]`  | master (direct, f77b353) |

**Loop CLOSED 2026-07-04T15:11Z:** re-grade at head f77b353 — all three
accepted, zero new findings (codex, codex-cli 0.142.5). The reviewed commits
remain unpushed pending the owner's push go.

Loop run 2026-07-04 (later) — reviewer: codex (codex-cli 0.142.5), scope:
release-plan slice 0, commits `baef818..26fd66f` (handshake -ServerCommand
mode + probe-results/state docs), fixes committed directly to `master` per
the recorded precedent. A three-lens pre-commit review (this harness's
subagents) ran before the codex dispatch; its 9 admitted findings were fixed
pre-commit (folded into a8553dc/8161af2) and 1 was declined (the default-mode
guard run did happen — agent's method summary was incomplete).

## Findings (slice-0 loop)

| ID     | Severity | Impact (one line)                                                   | Status | Branch |
|--------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|
| rel0-1 | LOW      | Documented `-ServerCommand <exe> [args...]` form fails binding for space-separated tokens | `[~]`  | master (direct, c80dfbf) |
